For the developer who takes the project:
take the device tree, the device common of the phone wilefox swift 2
and the vendor is very similar to that mobile but with 100% stock libs.
the rom compiles without errors, and starts but has several bugs.
* Wifi
* camera
* Audio
* brightness
* rotation
* sensors
* forced closure of two apps.
among others that I do not remember but not too many.
I leave the project standing because I could not solve them.
